# storage

## About

This application demonstrates use of the
[ariel-os-storage](https://ariel-os.github.io/ariel-os/dev/docs/api/ariel_os/storage/index.html)
API.

The example writes a number of key-value pairs to storage and retrieves them.
Different types of values are written to storage to demonstrate the capablities.
Values are also retrieved with different types as they were stored with, to show
how values are decoded when different types are used between `insert` and `get`.

Note: The application is not stateless, as it writes to flash.

## How to run

In this folder, run

    laze build -b nrf52840dk run

The application will store and read back a value to the flash.

When the maximum number of cycles have been reached
and the application exits early, the `flash-erase-all` command can be used:

    laze build -b nrf52840dk flash-erase-all

## Expected Output

When run, this example shows the following output:

When the initial counter reached the maximum number of executions, the following
output is produced:

    INFO  storage: using flash range 0xe000..0x10000
    INFO  Start storage example
    INFO  got counter value 11 from storage
    INFO  counter value > 10, aborting test to save flash cycles
